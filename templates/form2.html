    <form method="POST" action="{{ url_for('question2')}}">
        <p class="sectiontitle">Shedding Level:</p>
        <p class="section">How much fur and hair you can expect the breed to leave behind. Breeds with high shedding will need to be brushed more frequently, are more likely to trigger certain types of allergies, and are more likely to require more consistent vacuuming and lint-rolling.</br>
            <input type="radio" name="shedding" value="no_shedding">No Shedding</br>
			<input type="radio" name="shedding" value="everywhere">Hair Everywhere</br>
			<input type="radio" name="shedding" value="both" required>Both are fine</br>

        <p class="sectiontitle">Coat Grooming Frequency:</p>
        <p class="section">How frequently a breed requires bathing, brushing, trimming, or other kinds of coat maintenance. Consider how much time, patience, and budget you have for this type of care when looking at the grooming effort needed. All breeds require regular nail trimming.</br>

        </p>
        <p class="sectiontitle">Drooling Level:</p>
        <p class="section">How drool-prone a breed tends to be. If you're a neat freak, dogs that can leave ropes of slobber on your arm or big wet spots on your clothes may not be the right choice for you.</br>
            <input type="radio" name="drooling" value="less">Less Likely to Drool</br>
            <input type="radio" name="drooling" value="always">ALways Have a Towel</br>
